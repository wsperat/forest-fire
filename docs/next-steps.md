# Next steps

This page is for follow-up work that does not belong to a single feature page.

Some next steps are about training, some about runtime work, some about docs,
and some about benchmarking. The goal is to keep forward-looking notes in one
place instead of scattering them across otherwise stable reference pages.

## Gradient boosting parallelism

One of the clearest remaining training gaps is gradient-boosting parallelism.

Random forests parallelize naturally across trees, but boosting does not. Each
stage depends on the current ensemble state, so the outer training loop is
inherently sequential. The practical way to improve GBM CPU, and eventually GPU,
utilization is to make each individual tree fit much more parallel internally.

The highest-value strategy is:

- parallel histogram building with thread-local `count` / gradient / Hessian
  accumulators and a reduction step
- parallel split search across features once those histograms exist
- continued histogram subtraction so one child can be derived from the parent
  and its sibling instead of being rebuilt
- level-wise batching of active nodes where that is compatible with the tree
  family
- parallel row-index partitioning once the winning split has been chosen
- SIMD-friendly accumulation in the histogram hot path

The most important implementation detail is to separate stage-level seriality
from node-level parallelism:

- the boosting stage loop stays serial
- the work inside one stage should be aggressively parallel

That is the basic strategy used by systems like XGBoost, LightGBM, and
CatBoost. In practice, the first two steps above, histogram building and
feature-parallel split scoring, are likely to deliver the biggest visible gain.

## Random-forest training on wide data

Another clear next step is reducing RF training cost once feature counts become
moderate or large.

The current implementation parallelizes well across trees, but that is not the
same thing as making each tree cheap. In practice, the slowdown on wider tables
usually means the cost per node still scales too directly with the number of
features.

The most likely causes are:

- histogram construction is still too expensive in the hottest paths
- feature access is not cache-friendly enough on wide binned tables
- histogram subtraction and reuse are still incomplete in some important paths
- too much per-node scratch rebuilding or temporary allocation remains
- feature subsampling does not cut off enough work early enough

The main improvements to target are:

- make histogram construction the dominant optimization focus
- push histogram reuse further so one child can be built and the sibling derived
  by subtraction
- keep the training representation strongly feature-major so repeated scans over
  candidate columns stay cache-friendly
- batch active nodes by level where that improves locality and feature-parallel
  work
- ensure `max_features` gates the real hot path rather than only the final split
  comparison

This is one of the cases where profiling matters more than intuition. The most
useful breakdown to collect on wide RF workloads is:

- histogram building
- split scoring
- row partitioning
- temporary allocations
- bootstrap/index indirection overhead

The likely root issue is not lack of outer parallelism. It is that per-node
per-feature work is still too expensive once the width of the table grows.
